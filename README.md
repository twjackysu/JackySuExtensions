# Project Name Change Announcement

## Towards Community Collaboration

Dear Community,

As we continue on our journey towards fostering a more inclusive, collaborative, and community-driven project, I've made a pivotal decision that signifies a new chapter for our beloved project: **I am removing my name from the project name**.

### Why the Change?

The essence of open-source lies in collaboration, transparency, and the collective pursuit of improvement. While this project is deeply personal to me, its purpose extends far beyond any individual's accolades. It's about crafting a tool, a resource, a solution that benefits the broader community.

However, I've recognized that having a specific individual's name in the project title might inadvertently create barriers. It could convey the notion that this is more of an individual endeavor rather than a collective pursuit, potentially deterring talented individuals in our community from contributing, sharing ideas, or feeling part of this endeavor.

### An Important Update

In alignment with this new direction, **the project will no longer be maintained under its current name. All functionalities and future developments will be transitioned to the [DotnetSdkUtilities](https://github.com/twjackysu/DotnetSdkUtilities) project**. This move ensures that our efforts and your contributions are housed under a name that reflects our shared objectives and collective spirit.

### Moving Forward

By removing my name, I underscore our commitment to making this project genuinely open and driven by the community's collective genius. I encourage everyone to contribute, regardless of their background, expertise, or level of experience. This change is an invitation for collaborators, thinkers, and innovators from all corners of the globe to join us in enhancing this project's robustness, versatility, and impact.

### Your Role

This is where you come in. Your insights, feedback, and contributions will be instrumental in elevating this project to new heights. Whether it's through coding, documentation, issue reporting, or idea sharing, every bit of involvement enriches our shared journey.

### Let's Build Together

I am immensely thankful for the support, enthusiasm, and passion that you, our community, have shown. As I embark on this renewed path, I look forward to seeing where this collective effort will lead us.

Thank you for being part of this journey. Together, let's continue to build, innovate, and improve.

Sincerely,

Jacky Su
